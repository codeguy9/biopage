            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>As a freelance web developer, I specialize in crafting responsive websites using core technologies like HTML and CSS.
                 My work involves writing clean and efficient code to ensure optimal performance and user experience. <br><br>
                 I focus on creating visually appealing layouts that enhance usability and accessibility across various devices.
                   I am committed to staying updated with the latest web standards and best practices to deliver modern solutions.
                    Through rigorous testing and debugging, I ensure that every website functions flawlessly before launch.
                     My approach emphasizes client satisfaction, as I strive to meet their specific requirements and exceed their
                      expectations.
