            <h1>Web Design</h1>
            <p>As a freelance web designer, I leverage software like Figma and Photoshop to create visually
                 engaging and user-centered websites. I apply UI principles such as color theory, typography, 
                 and wireframe development to enhance the overall design quality.<br><br> Conducting thorough UX research 
                 allows me to understand user needs and preferences, ensuring a tailored design approach. I prioritize
                  accessibility in my projects, ensuring that all users can interact with my designs seamlessly. 
                  My design process incorporates empathy maps to better understand user emotions and behaviors, fostering
                   a more intuitive experience. Collaborating closely with clients, I translate their visions into functional,
                    aesthetically pleasing designs. Through continuous learning and adaptation to industry trends,
                     I strive to stay ahead in the ever-evolving web design landscape.
