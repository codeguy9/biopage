            <h1>Photo Editing</h1>
            <p>I utilize advanced software like Photoshop and Lightroom to deliver high-quality visual enhancements.
                Color correction and enhancement ensures that images achieve optimal vibrancy and clarity. <br><br>
                I specialize in creating polished and professional looks for various applications.
                 Through complex compositing techniques, I merge multiple images to produce striking visuals that tell a story.
                  I am skilled in color change, allowing me to creatively transform the mood and tone of an image.
                   Object removal is another critical service I offer, ensuring that the focus remains where it belongs. 
                   By maintaining open communication with clients, I ensure that their vision is accurately captured and brought to
                    life in every project.
